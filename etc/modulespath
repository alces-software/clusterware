#  System MODULEPATH setup file
#  ============================
#
#  This file defines the initial setup for the system-wide portion of
#  the module files search path. System-wide paths are added first,
#  user-specific paths contained in ~/.modules are added subsequently.
#
#  Comments may be added anywhere, which begin on # and continue until the
#     end of the line
#  Each line containing a single path will be added to the MODULEPATH
#     environment variable. You may add as many as you want - just
#     limited by the maximum variable size of your shell.
#
#  Please do not remove lines prefixed with `#=`.
